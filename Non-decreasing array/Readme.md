# Non-decreasing array

Given an array nums with n integers, your task is to check if it could become non-decreasing by<br> modifying at most 1 element.

We define an array is non-decreasing if nums[i] <= nums[i + 1] holds for every<br> i (0-based) such that (0 <= i <= n - 2).

Example 1:<br>
Input: nums = [4,2,3]<br>
Output: true<br>
Explanation: You could modify the first 4 to 1 to get a non-decreasing array.<br>

Example 2:<br>
Input: nums = [4,2,1]<br>
Output: false<br>
Explanation: You can't get a non-decreasing array by modify at most one element.<br>
